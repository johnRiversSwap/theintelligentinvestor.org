                            The objective of this article is to analyze HelloFresh, the meal-kit company, in accordance with the <a href="../learn/key-quantitative-metrics-to-identify-high-quality-companies.html">quantitative</a>, <a href="../learn/key-qualitative-attributes-high-quality-companies-must-have.html">qualitative</a>, and valuation principles outlined in previous blog posts. The aim is to ascertain whether it represents a favorable investment opportunity at present.

                        <ol>
                            <li id="section1">
                                <b>Why did I get interested in HelloFresh?</b>
                                <p>My initial interest in this business stemmed from personal experience. Both my partner and I share a dislike for cooking, prompting us to explore alternatives. We stumbled upon 'Wetaka', a Spanish private company that offers weekly delivery of prepared dishes. While the food quality wasn't exceptional, it sufficiently alleviated the hassle of shopping, cooking, and cleaning. Despite its slightly elevated price point, we opted to continue using the service. This prompted me to delve deeper into the leading players in the ready-to-eat food delivery industry, given the substantial societal shifts favoring such services:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Key among these shifts is the departure from traditional gender roles in meal preparation, with both young men and women now expressing aversion to cooking. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Additionally, there's a growing awareness of the importance of balanced, healthy diets, further driving demand for convenient meal solutions, especially among metropolitan inhabitants who work in large corporate firms.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <p>Upon closer examination, I discovered that HelloFresh was at the forefront of this sector. While their primary business had previously revolved around delivering meal kits requiring cooking, they had pivoted towards acquiring companies offering pre-prepared meals, akin to Wetaka. Furthermore, the current valuation of HelloFresh presents an attractive proposition, being more affordable than ever since the company's initial public offering in 2016. These two facts prompted me to delve further into my analysis.</p>

                                <b>Understanding the business.</b>  
                                <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                                    <li>
                                        <p style="margin:0">What products or services does the company sell? What are its different revenue streams? That is, do you understand how exactly the company earns money?</p>
                                        <p >HelloFresh has two main revenue streams and is now expanding into new verticals:</p>
                                        <u >Home Cooking (81.6% of FY2023 revenue)</u>
                                        <p>Home Cooking was the company's original focus. Under the brand 'HelloFresh', users subscribe to a weekly meal service where they receive a box containing fresh, pre-measured ingredients along with step-by-step recipe manuals. This service eliminates the need to visit supermarkets, decide on meals, and ensures balanced eating.</p>
                                        <p>Over the years, the company has acquired other meal kit delivery brands, such as 'Green Chef' with premium ingredients, 'Every Plate' offering budget-friendly options, 'Chefs Plate', and 'Good Chop' for responsibly raised meat. </p>
                                        <p>Home Cooking represents a mature market, having been available in the US since 2013 and experiencing significant growth, especially propelled by COVID-19, with meal deliveries quadrupling since 2019. Therefore, the company is grappling with challenges in new customer acquisition, anticipating lower delivery volumes in 2024 compared to 2023. With more moderate growth expectations, company will target faster expansion of meal kit earnings than top-line in the coming years. Nevertheless, it is projected that adjusted EBITDA for 2024 will be inferior to that of 2023, primarily due to fixed cost impacts resulting from volume deleveraging and the implementation of modern fulfillment centers with higher efficiency targets, albeit with initial additional costs.</p>
                                        <u>Ready-To-Eat (18.4% of FY2023 revenue)</u>
                                        <p>Ready-To-Eat (RTE) meals are precisely as the name implies: food delivered to your home that requires only heating before consumption. The company acquired Factor, a US brand, in 2020. Since then, Factor's scale has increased more than tenfold, with a 60% growth recorded during 2023 alone. HelloFresh anticipates further growth of over 50% in 2024 compared to 2023. RTE is evidently considered the primary growth driver for the company for both 2024 and 2025, with plans to expand the brand into additional geographical markets. Already making strides in this direction, the company launched Factor in Canada in late 2022, acquired YouFoodz, another RTE brand in Australia, and introduced Factor in the Netherlands in August 2023. The expansion into new locations will continue in 2024.</p>
                                        <u>New verticals (still testing product-market fit)</u>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>'The Pets Table': Direct-to-Customer (D2C) pet food subscription, capitalizing on the humanization of pets trend.</li>

                                        <p style="margin:0">How stable is the demand for the company's products?</p>
                                        <p style="margin:0">HelloFresh faces a challenge in customer loyalty, evident in high churn rates. According to <a href="https://www.bernsteinresearch.com/CMSObjectBR/Files/Recruiting/Hello%20Fresh%20-%20Paying%20People%20to%20Eat%202022.pdf" target="_blank">bernsteinresearch</a>, only 30% of customers were retained in Q4, while <a href="https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/meal-kit-competitors-blue-apron-nyse-aprn-hellofresh-customer-retention-market-share/" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reports a retention rate of only 10% in the 11th month. However, despite these high churn rates, HelloFresh has managed to maintain a consistent base of active customers exceeding 6 million over the past three years. This suggests the existence of a core group of customers who remain loyal to the product. Despite the tailwinds provided by COVID-19, which are gradually fading, this core customer group continues to support the company. The number of active HelloFresh customers worldwide from 2016 to 2023 illustrates this trend:</p>

                                        <p style="margin:0">Is the company highly dependent on external factors?</p>
                                        <p>While the company is affected by macroeconomic conditions, I wouldn't characterize its dependency as highly significant. Historically, challenges have arisen from high inflation, making it difficult to pass on price increases to customers. Additionally, recessions or reductions in consumer spending may impact demand, particularly due to the comparatively higher prices of meal kits compared to purchasing ingredients directly from supermarkets.</p>
                                    </li>

                                <p>The truth is, the company's financial metrics appear quite favorable, with strong six-year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) across revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margins, and return on invested capital (ROIC). Additionally, the company maintains a manageable level of debt, generates free cash flow (€78M for FY2023) and dilution is not excessive given its growth over the past six years. Regarding ROIC, arguably the most critical metric, the fact that the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is lower than its ROIC, indicates that it is not destroying value as it expands. The only drawback appears to be the underperformance of the stock price since the IPO, which is likely tied to valuation issues, as will be discussed in <a href="../thesis/hellofresh.html#section7">section 7</a>.</p>

                                <p>The only significant competitive advantage (MOAT) that HelloFresh possesses is its 'economies of scale'. As the company continues to increase its volumes and expand into synergistic verticals, its costs decrease. This is due to enhanced bargaining power with suppliers, optimization of its supply chain network, and improved manufacturing capabilities. Consequently, HelloFresh can lower prices and reach a broader audience, thus creating entry barriers for competitors.</p>

                                <p>Additionally, albeit to a lesser extent in my opinion, HelloFresh benefits from intangible assets, particularly brand recognition. As demonstrated in <a href="../thesis/hellofresh.html#section2">section 2</a>, the company maintains a dominant position as the global market leader in meal-kit and ready-to-eat deliveries.</p>

                                  <b>Why is the market sentiment so negative towards HelloFresh?</b>
                                  <p>In my opinion, this negativity stems from the significant risks outlined in <a href="../thesis/hellofresh.html#section6">section 6</a>, which are substantial and cannot be disregarded. Other reasons may include:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Lots of negativity due to terrible stock price performance: -41.2% since IPO (Nov’2017) and -93.3% since peak (Aug’21).</li>
                                    <li>Absence from notable investor portfolios (<a href="https://www.dataroma.com/m/home.php" target="_blank">https://www.dataroma.com/m/home.php</a>).</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <br>
                                  <b>If the stock market closes for 10 years, would I be ok holding the company? (i.e. Terminal Value)</b>
                                  <p>In my view, a company that generates free cash flow, maintains manageable debt, and holds a dominant market position (close to a monopoly) has minimal chances of bankruptcy and dissolution.</p>
                                  <b>Security margin</b>
                                  <p>Here's my valuation, assuming quite conservative hypotheses: the scenario below considers that during the next 5 years: a) the company grows revenue at 1% annually; b) EBITDA margin improves from 5.9% to 7.0% (company's stated long-term goal is 10.0%). With these numbers, and considering how competitors are valued, it is not far-fetched to expect the EV/EBITDA multiple to improve to 5x, resulting in an annual Enterprise Value growth of 15.4% by 2028. If dilution continues at the same rate as in past years, 0.49% annually, and cash and debt doesn’t change much, we can anticipate the stock price to increase by more than 90% from current levels (or >14% CAGR).</p>

                                <b>Conclusion.</b>  
                                <p>In my assessment, with the current share price of €6.45, HelloFresh appears undervalued and shows potential to outperform the market. I anticipate stable revenue growth at a low single-digit rate in the short term, with Ready-To-Eat (RTE) products gradually gaining a larger market share. Eventually, this vertical may also peak, prompting the company to focus on enhancing margins, generating free cash flow, and returning capital to shareholders. I hold this belief because I see a global market for such products/services (home cooking meal kits and ready-to-eat), evidenced by a loyal customer base exceeding 6 million active users. This market is further bolstered by the tailwinds mentioned in <a href="../thesis/hellofresh.html#section1">section 1</a>, and HelloFresh is positioned to remain the dominant player due to its competitive advantages outlined in <a href="../thesis/hellofresh.html#section5">section 5</a>. Moreover, given the company's robust balance sheet and proven hyper-scaling playbook, there is ample opportunity for further acquisitions (perhaps including the aforementioned Wetaka Spanish company).</p>
                                <p>However, I anticipate the stock price to remain low for some time, as the market would need to see some positive numbers (in terms of revenue growth or margin improvement, which doesn’t seem likely to occur in 2024) before changing sentiment. Additionally, it seems unlikely that there will be other catalysts soon, such as M&A activities or inclusion in new indexes (the company is currently in MDAX after dropping from DAX in 2022 and is quite distant from its last component, Zalando).</p>
